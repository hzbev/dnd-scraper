Fizban's Platinum Shield (UA)
Source: Unearthed Arcana 78 - Draconic Options
6th-level abjuration
Casting Time: 1 action

Range: 60 feet

Components: V, S, M (a platinum-plated dragon scale, worth at least 500 gp)

Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
You create a field of silvery light that surrounds a creature of your choice within range (you can choose yourself). The field sheds dim light out to 5 feet.
As a bonus action on subsequent turns, you can move the field to another creature within 60 feet of the field.
The creature protected by the field gains the following benefits:

The creature has half cover.
The creature has resistance to acid, cold, fire, lightning, and poison damage.
If the creature is subjected to an effect that allows it to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, the creature instead takes no damage if it succeeds on the saving throw, and only half damage if it fails.
